# ðŸ¤“ C# History Explorer

A simple app to explore each version of C#, along with each versions list of features. Currently, each feature is simply a link to the corresponding official Microsoft docs, however, I'd like to eventually expose each feature with RAG, see [Future work](#future-work).

Demo app: https://ievangelist.github.io/csharp-history-explorer

## Future work

- Add `Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)` for content.
  - Query static content, feed it into OpenAI prompt, then generate new explainations of each version.
